As systems grow more complex, determining how services communicate and cooperate to achieve tasks becomes critical for balancing flexibility, maintainability, and performance. Two common approaches to workflow design are orchestration and delegation (choreography).</p> <p>In this document, the focus will lean toward favoring orchestration as the default design approach, primarily due to its simplicity, clarity, and centralized control. Delegation, on the other hand, will be discussed as a less common alternative\u2014best suited for specific cases when tighter service autonomy is required.</p> <p>Through the lens of an order management system, this document explores two sequence diagrams that illustrate these approaches. Though this is just one example. This discussion extends to any distributed system where workflows involve multiple stages of service interaction, regardless of the specific domain. The aim is to analyze the design trade-offs with an understanding that orchestration is the preferred approach unless a compelling reason to delegate tasks arises.</p> <p>By the end of this article, you will gain insights into:</p> <ul> <li>The pros of orchestration and why it is often the default choice.</li> <li>Practical scenarios where delegation may be more appropriate.</li> <li>Key considerations for choosing between centralized and decentralized workflows.</li> <li>An example of how reusability plays a role in workflow design.</li> </ul> <p>Let\u2019s dive in!</p>"},{"location":"design-decisions/orchestrate-vs-delegate/#what-is-the-orderservice","title":"What is the OrderService?","text":"<p>At the center of the examples in this article is the <code>OrderService</code>, a key component in managing interactions between the client and supporting services needed for end-to-end order processing.
