# Orchestrate vs Delegate: A Practical Guide for Workflow Design

Designing efficient and scalable workflows is one of the cornerstone challenges in modern distributed systems. As systems grow more complex, determining how services communicate and cooperate to achieve tasks becomes critical for balancing flexibility, maintainability, and performance. Two common approaches to workflow design are **orchestration** and **delegation (choreography).**

In this document, the focus will lean toward **favoring orchestration** as the default design approach, primarily due to its simplicity, clarity, and centralized control. Delegation, on the other hand, will be discussed as a less common alternative—best suited for specific cases when tighter service autonomy is required.

Through the lens of an order management system, this document explores two sequence diagrams that illustrate these approaches. Though this is just one example. This discussion extends to any distributed system where workflows involve multiple stages of service interaction, regardless of the specific domain. The aim is to analyze the design trade-offs with an understanding that orchestration is the preferred approach unless a compelling reason to delegate tasks arises.

By the end of this article, you will gain insights into:

- The pros of orchestration and why it is often the default choice.
- Practical scenarios where delegation may be more appropriate.
- Key considerations for choosing between centralized and decentralized workflows.
- An example of how reusability plays a role in workflow design.

Let’s dive in!

## What is the OrderService?

At the center of the examples in this article is the `OrderService`, a key component in managing interactions between the client and supporting services needed for end-to-end order processing. Its primary responsibilities include:

1. **Checking Inventory**: Ensuring the items requested by the client are available.
2. **Processing Payment**: Authorizing and completing payment transactions.
3. **Scheduling Shipment**: Coordinating delivery of the order items to the client.

The role of the `OrderService` varies depending on the chosen architectural approach:

- In an **orchestration** design, the `OrderService` acts as a centralized controller, overseeing and coordinating the entire workflow.
- In a **delegation** design, the `OrderService` acts only as an initiator, delegating responsibilities to individual services that then interact directly with one another to complete tasks.

In most cases—especially when the system is a single application (e.g., a Java service)—orchestration is often preferred for its clarity and ease of implementation. Delegation may, however, be necessary when working with distributed microservices that operate autonomously and require network calls.

## Diagram 1: Delegation with Sequential Workflow

In this approach, delegation is the primary design. Services interact with each other directly in a sequential, tightly coupled manner. The workflow looks like this:

``` mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant OrderService
    participant InventoryService
    participant PaymentService
    participant ShippingService

    Client->>OrderService: Request Order
    activate OrderService
    OrderService->>InventoryService: Check Stock
    activate InventoryService
    InventoryService->>PaymentService: Process Payment
    activate PaymentService
    PaymentService->>ShippingService: Schedule Shipment
    activate ShippingService
    ShippingService-->>PaymentService: Shipment Scheduled
    deactivate ShippingService
    PaymentService-->>InventoryService: Payment Confirmed
    deactivate PaymentService
    InventoryService-->>OrderService: Inventory Updated
    deactivate InventoryService
    OrderService-->>Client: Order Confirmed
    deactivate OrderService
```

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Tightly Coupled Cross-Service Interactions**:
    - Each service interacts directly with the next. For instance, `InventoryService` invokes `PaymentService`, which then invokes `ShippingService`.
    - This introduces interdependent services, where a failure in one service can cause cascading failures.

2. **Responsibility Delegation**:
    - The `OrderService` acts as an initial coordinator, but it delegates responsibilities to downstream services. Each service is responsible for invoking the next service in the sequence.

3. **Complex Error Handling**:
    - Failure in one service must be communicated back upstream, requiring rollback or compensation mechanisms that are harder to implement.

4. **Service Level Autonomy**:
    - This design supports independent service lifecycles, making it more suited for distributed microservice architectures where services need to operate independently.

#### Why Orchestration May Be Preferred:

While delegation can appear simpler when working with distributed services, its tightly coupled nature makes error handling and visibility more challenging. If this workflow were implemented within a single application, it would quickly become convoluted and unnecessarily complex. For a single application, orchestration would be the better choice.

## Diagram 2: Centralized Workflow with Orchestration

In this approach, orchestration is the primary design. The `OrderService` acts as a centralized controller, managing interactions with all other services. The workflow looks like this:

``` mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant OrderService
    participant InventoryService
    participant PaymentService
    participant ShippingService

    Client->>OrderService: Request Order
    activate OrderService
    OrderService->>InventoryService: Check Stock
    activate InventoryService
    InventoryService-->>OrderService: Inventory Updated
    deactivate InventoryService
    OrderService->>PaymentService: Process Payment
    activate PaymentService
    PaymentService-->>OrderService: Payment Confirmed
    deactivate PaymentService
    OrderService->>ShippingService: Schedule Shipment
    activate ShippingService
    ShippingService-->>OrderService: Shipment Scheduled
    deactivate ShippingService
    OrderService-->>Client: Order Confirmed
    deactivate OrderService
```

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Central Coordination**:
    - The `OrderService` controls the entire workflow, making it easier to manage and monitor.

2. **Loose Coupling**:
    - Each service performs its task independently and returns the result to the `OrderService`, reducing direct interdependencies.

3. **Simplified Error Handling**:
    - The `OrderService` can implement centralized error handling and recovery mechanisms without relying on individual downstream services.

4. **Client Visibility**:
    - The client sees only the `OrderService`, making the workflow transparent and easier to maintain.

#### Why Orchestration is Preferred Here:

For most cases—especially when the system is a single application—centralized orchestration is simpler to implement and maintain. The workflow is clear, error handling is centralized, and the services are loosely coupled. Even in microservice architectures, orchestration can simplify overall system design by keeping control centralized.

## Orchestration vs Delegation: When to Choose What?

While orchestration is often the preferred approach, delegation may be a better fit under these specific circumstances:

- **Microservices Architecture**: If each service runs as an autonomous microservice requiring network calls, delegation can enhance independence and scalability.
- **Performance-Sensitive Workflows**: Delegation might reduce latency by enabling services to directly communicate with each other without routing everything through a centralized orchestrator.
- **High Service Autonomy**: If each service is developed and maintained by separate teams with limited coordination, delegation may help preserve service independence.

Orchestration, however, is preferred when:

- **Single Application**: For workflows running entirely within a single Java (or other language) application, orchestration is simpler and easier to implement.
- **Simplified Error Handling**: Centralized workflows accommodate easier rollback and better control over compensation logic during failures.
- **Monitoring and Visibility**: The orchestrator provides a clear overview of the entire workflow, making it easier to manage and debug.

#### Comparison Table:

| Aspect | **Orchestration** | **Delegation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Control** | Centralized workflow via a single service | Distributed, peer-to-peer interaction |
| **Coupling** | Loose coupling between services | Tightly coupled services |
| **Error Handling** | Centralized error handling | More complex due to interdependent services |
| **Scalability** | Easier to scale services individually | Services are more autonomous |
| **Reusability** | Shared workflows and simplicity | Repeated service logic may be required |


## Real-World Example: Reusable Workflows in Retail Systems

Let’s consider a real-world example to illustrate the importance of reusability when designing workflows for the `OrderService`.

Imagine you are building an order management system for two different types of businesses under the same company:

1. **Online Retail Store**: Customers place orders through a website or mobile app. The system must check inventory, process payments, and schedule shipping for the delivery of goods.
2. **Physical Retail Store**: Customers make purchases in person using a register. The system still checks inventory to ensure stock availability and may process payments for customers using credit cards. However, scheduling a shipping service isn’t necessary because the customer is already walking away with the purchase.

In this scenario:

- Both workflows share common steps: **checking inventory** and **processing payments.**
- However, the **“schedule shipping”** step only applies to the online store.

### Designing for Reusability:
By favoring **orchestration**, you can design centralized workflows that are modular and reusable. For example:

- The `OrderService` can define a high-level workflow, such as:

    1. Check inventory.
    2. Process payment.
    3. Optionally schedule shipping.

- This centralized workflow ensures that common steps like inventory checks and payment processing are shared between the physical and online store systems. At the same time, the `OrderService` can skip the unnecessary steps (like scheduling shipment) when invoked by a physical store.

This modularity demonstrates the flexibility and reusability that orchestration provides. It allows you to:

- Reuse the same components (inventory checking, payment processing) across workflows.
- Minimize duplication of logic across systems.
- Make future extensions easier, such as adding a new step (e.g., applying loyalty points) while keeping the core process consistent.

#### Why Delegation Falls Short Here:
If you were to use delegation, each service would need to decide what the next call should be, based on the business context (e.g., whether to schedule shipping). This makes the logic embedded in the services themselves and makes reuse between workflows less intuitive. Instead of centralizing control in the `OrderService`, business logic would need to be repeatedly implemented in each service, which leads to tight coupling and loss of reusability.

In this example, orchestration clearly stands out as the better approach—it streamlines workflow reusability and ensures clarity when different workflows share core tasks but diverge at certain points.

## Conclusion

For most workflows, **orchestration is the preferred approach**. Its centralized control, loose coupling, and simplified error handling make it an easy-to-maintain and scalable solution, particularly within single applications. Delegation, while less common, is worth considering when working with distributed microservices or when service autonomy and low-latency interactions are critical.

When defaulting to orchestration, don't forget to carefully evaluate whether delegation might provide unique advantages in your use case. While orchestration is simpler and reusable in most scenarios, delegation has intrinsic value in distributed and independent service architectures.

Ultimately, the decision should be driven by the needs of the system you’re designing. As a general rule of thumb—favor orchestration unless there’s a compelling reason to adopt delegation. And in some cases, a hybrid approach combining elements of both may provide the best of both worlds.
